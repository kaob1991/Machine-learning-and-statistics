    "\n",
    "Lady tasting tea is a experiment designed by the polymath Ronald Fisher that was reported in his 1935 book \"The Design of Experiments\"[1] \n",
    "\n",
    "![](Youngronaldfisher2.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment is the original exposition of his notion of a null hypothesis - ie: a statement that is generally assumed to remain possibly true, and researchers work to reject, nullify or disprove this statement.The concept of the null hypothesis is a fundamental part of the scientific process.[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "In his book he describes a null hypothesis, as something which is \"never proved or established, but is possibly disproved, in the course of experimentation\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A colleague of Fisher's, Muriel Bristol, claimed to be able to tell whether the tea or the milk was added first to a cup. Fisher was extremely sceptical of this procamation and himself and a 3rd colleague William Roach, put together an experiment to test her ability. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was this simple experiment that led Fisher to do important work in the design of statistically valid experiments based on the statistical significance of experimental results. He developed Fisher's exact test to assess the probabilities and statistical significance of experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "Fisher proposed to give her eight cups, four of each variety, in random order. One could then ask what the probability was for her getting the specific number of cups she identified correct, but just by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there was 4 cups with tea in first; and 4 cups with milk first what is the chance that she would guess the correct cups.\n",
    "\n",
    "In null-hypothesis significance testing, the p-value is the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the result actually observed, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct.[6]\n",

    "Student's T-test is a test developed by a scientist, William Sealy Gosset, working in the guinness factory in Dublin in the early 1900's- late 1800's. He became interested in the problems around small sample sizes, as the factory was sometimes limited to small samples of raw products. One theory on the naming of the test was that the company policy at the time was to use an alias when publishing. Gosset used the alias Student, thus informing the name Student's t-test. The other theory was that Guinness factory wanted to run tests on quality assurance on the raw materials that were being used in production, and didn't want their competitors to know. \n",
    "\n",
    "The t-distribution is part of a family of continuous probability distributions that arise when estimating the mean of a normally distributed population where the sample size is small and the standard deviation is unknown. This distribution plays a role the Student's t-test for assessing the statistical significance of the difference between two sample means, the construction of confidence intervals for the difference between two population means, and in linear regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of T-tests\n",
    "\n",
    "The most frequently used t-tests are one-sample and two-sample tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A one-sample location test of whether the mean of a population has a value specified in a null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A two-sample location test of the null hypothesis such that the means of two populations are equal. All such tests are usually called Student's t-tests, though strictly speaking that name should only be used if the variances of the two populations are also assumed to be equal; the form of the test used when this assumption is dropped is sometimes called Welch's t-test. These tests are often referred to as unpaired or independent samples t-tests, as they are typically applied when the statistical units underlying the two samples being compared are non-overlapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Paired samples\n",
    "Paired samples t-tests typically consist of a sample of matched pairs of similar units, or one group of units that has been tested twice (a \"repeated measures\" t-test).\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical example of the repeated measures t-test would be where subjects are tested prior to a treatment, say for high blood pressure, and the same subjects are tested again after treatment with a blood-pressure-lowering medication. By comparing the same patient's numbers before and after treatment, we are effectively using each patient as their own control. That way the correct rejection of the null hypothesis (here: of no difference made by the treatment) can become much more likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Independent (unpaired) samples\n",
    "The independent samples t-test is used when two separate sets of independent and identically distributed samples are obtained, and one variable from each of the two populations is compared. For example, suppose we are evaluating the effect of a medical treatment, and we enroll 100 subjects into our study, then randomly assign 50 subjects to the treatment group and 50 subjects to the control group. In this case, we have two independent samples and would use the unpaired form of the t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Scipy.stats.ttest_ind\n",
    "\n",
    "This function calculates the t-test for the means of 2 independent samples of scores. By this we mean that the data in one sample is unrelated to the other. Compare this to a paired samples t-test which can compare before/after scores on interventionalist studies. \n",
    "It is important that researchers and analysts understand the data that they are analysing, in order to pick the correct analysis tools for the job. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the independent sample t-test the test assumes that the populations have identical variances by default. The test is for the null hypothesis that 2 independent samples have identical average (expected) values.[1]\n",

Otherwise, permutations is the number of random permutations that will be used to estimate p-values using a permutation test. If permutations equals or exceeds the number of distinct partitions of the pooled data, an exact test is performed instead (i.e. each distinct partition is used exactly once).\n",

The p-value quantifies the probability of observing more extreme values assuming the null hypothesis, that the samples are drawn from populations with the same population means, is true. A p-value larger than a chosen threshold (e.g. 5% or 1%) indicates that our observation is not so unlikely to have occurred by chance. Therefore, we do not reject the null hypothesis of equal population means. If the p-value is smaller than our threshold, then we have evidence against the null hypothesis of equal population means.\n",
