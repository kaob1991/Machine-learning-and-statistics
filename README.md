This is submitted in partial fulfillment of a H.Dip in Data Analytics in Computing. 

Author: Katie O'Brien G00398250 

***

The student was asked to complete a series of exercises as part of weekly tasks, and submit these to a repository on GitHub. The student was also tasked with re-creating the __Keras Time Series Anomaly__  task that is available at the following website: https://keras.io/examples/timeseries/timeseries_anomaly_detection/


## Marks were to be given as follows: 

- Presentation of GitHub repository (20%): <br>

  • Create a GitHub repository of a standard presentable in interviews. <br>
  • Include an informative and concise README.  <br>
  • Organize your repository — no unnecessary files or clutter.  <br>
  • Work regularly, adding regular reasonably-sized commits.  <br>
  
  
- Regular tasks (40%): <br>

  • The lecture notes suggest concepts you should explore <br>
  • You should complete these in notebooks each week <br>
  • Plots explaining main concepts. <br>
  • Code demonstrating key algorithms. <br>
  • Well-written explanations <br>
  
- Machine Learning Project Notebook (40%): <br>

  • On the keras website, there is an example of time-series anomaly 
   Re-create this example in a notebook of your own,
   explaining the concepts <br>
  • Clearly explain each keras function used, referring to the documentation. <br>
  • Include an introduction to your notebook, setting the context and
  describing what the reader can expect as they read down through
  the notebook. <br>
  • Include a conclusion section where you suggest improvements you
  could make to the analysis in the notebook. <br>


## The Repository 

This repository contains a number of jupyter notebooks that are viewable in several ways: 
  - Firstly, they can be viewed in the GitHub repository here by clicking into each. They will be rendered in GitHub but are not customizable or editable
  
  - They can also be viewed using NBviewer:
    - The Statistics one is available at: https://nbviewer.org/github/kaob1991/Machine-learning-and-statistics/blob/main/Statistics.ipynb
    - The Models one is available at: https://nbviewer.org/github/kaob1991/Machine-learning-and-statistics/blob/main/models.ipynb
    - The Parameters one is available at: https://nbviewer.org/github/kaob1991/Machine-learning-and-statistics/blob/main/parameters.ipynb
    - The Keras one is available at: https://nbviewer.org/github/kaob1991/Machine-learning-and-statistics/blob/main/Keras%20Time-series%20Anomaly.ipynb
  
  - Finally, they can also be viewed on Binder which allows the user to make edits without downloading the file: 
    - Statistics: https://hub.gke2.mybinder.org/user/kaob1991-machin--and-statistics-xph8xehi/notebooks/Statistics.ipynb
    - Models: https://hub.gke2.mybinder.org/user/kaob1991-machin--and-statistics-ura92vn8/notebooks/models.ipynb
    - Parameters: https://hub.gke2.mybinder.org/user/kaob1991-machin--and-statistics-hya8okgh/notebooks/parameters.ipynb
    - Keras: https://hub.gke2.mybinder.org/user/kaob1991-machin--and-statistics-6qp76cty/notebooks/Keras%20Time-series%20Anomaly.ipynb
    
## The Notebooks

### Statistics: 
 
 This notebook contains exercises from the first 2 weeks of the course. It asks the student to complete a number of exercises around the "lady tasting tea" experiment and also to explain how independent sample t-tests work 
 
### Models:
 This notebook asks the user to plot the absolute value function explaining why it is not typically used for plotting straight lines. 
It then asks the user to plot using 3 given ```numpy`` functions and explain whether or not they are good for plotting straight lines

### Parameters:
This asks the student to use ```numpy.polyfit()``` to plot data. 

### Keras: 

This notebook is used to recreate the time-series anomaly notebook with explanations.
